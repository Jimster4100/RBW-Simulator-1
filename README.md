# RBW Simulator

This repository contains the **RBW Simulator**, an open-source implementation of a **dual-incidence graph-based discrete event model of spacetime**. The simulator is used to analyze constrained probability distributions within the **Relational Block World (RBW) framework**, inspired by the work of Stuckey et al.

## Purpose
This simulation investigates the emergence of structured probability distributions in a **minimal events-only RBW model**. In particular, numerical experiments reveal an **unexpected affinity to the fine-structure constant** (\(\alpha \approx 0.007297\)) and its structured periodic behavior.

## Contents
- **RBW Simulator.ipynb**: A Jupyter Notebook containing code for generating and analyzing probability distributions on a **dual-incidence graph**.
- **Example Outputs**: Visualizations and data demonstrating structured behavior in constrained probability flow.
- **Dependencies**: Python libraries required to run the notebook.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
2. Install dependencies:
3. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook:
